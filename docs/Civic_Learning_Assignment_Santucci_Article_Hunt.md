Civic Learning Assignment Guide

# Building Reading Skills and Scientific Thinking with the Article Hunt

**Creator:** Jack Santucci, Professorial Lecturer, Political Science

**Original Class Context:** PSC 2220 Public Opinion, PSC 2211 State & Urban Politics, and PSC 3192W American Populism

**Purpose:** Cultivate epistemic humility and skills needed to draw critically (not cherry-pick) from social-science research.

**Activity Type:** Individual assignment or small-group activity. The skills also can be used on the fly in class discussion.

**Time:** 1-2 class sessions, then about 2 hours’ independent work.

**Class Size:** Any. However, teaching assistants may be needed for grading with large enrollments.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, students will demonstrate an ability to:

* Find journal articles on topics of interest to them.  
* Verify that such an article is peer-reviewed.  
* Identify the central cause-effect claim of a journal article.  
* Say what evidence on which it rests.  
* Say how the claim modifies, falsifies, or enhances one from a different reading (e.g., one central to a syllabus).  
* Say what sorts of policy intervention(s) the claim implies.  
* Point to weaknesses in a truth claim.

# Task Instructions

1. Show students the assignment [worksheet](https://www.jacksantucci.com/docs/syllabi/article_hunt_outline.docx), and explain key terms in it.  
   1. Give a lecture on the meanings of: cause, effect, dependent variable, independent variable, case (unit of analysis), hypothesis, and research types (if applicable).  
   2. Show how these things can be found in the abstract of a journal article.  
   3. Discuss what to do (skim the article) if something cannot be found or is not clearly stated in the abstract.  
   4. Explain the value of looking up unfamiliar terms. Often, this can be done by highlighting and right-clicking such terms.  
2. Show students how to use Google Scholar and the Gelman Library website.  
   1. Emphasize filters like publication date and number of citations.  
   2. Emphasize the importance of journal titles (see 3 below).  
3. Show students how to know if an article is peer-reviewed and what discipline produced it.  
4. OPTIONAL PRACTICE: Ask students to complete the worksheet in small groups. Let each group find an article its own, or assign articles to groups.  
5. Show the assignment worksheet once more, and answer remaining questions. For example, it may be helpful to show students how to use a plain-text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) to remove formatting from an article’s abstract.

# Criteria for Success

* A [worksheet](https://www.jacksantucci.com/docs/syllabi/article_hunt_outline.docx) asks a series of pointed questions about the learning objectives.  
* Instructors should feel free to tailor it.

# Additional Notes for the Instructor

* This assignment was designed for courses that presume a falsificationist research approach. Thoughts on using it with other approaches (e.g., qualitative methods, critical theory) are in the journal article below (Appendix D).  
* Students sometimes reverse the dependent and independent variables. I find it useful to mention this possibility in class.  
* Grades tend to be high. I mostly use the assignment at the start of a term to prepare students for class papers, literature reviews, and doing later readings.  
* Giving the assignment early in the term also can reinforce the value of participating in class and doing readings. Most students who struggle with the assignment do so on the part that asks them to relate their chosen article to a reading from the course. That’s because they often have not done much reading or paid attention in class.  
* Reinforce the overall goals of critical thinking and epistemic humility by using the assignment on the fly in class discussion. For example, if a student makes a point and I know there exists an article on it, I find the article, put the abstract on the screen, and ask students to use their “article hunt” skills.
