    "section": "",
    "text": "Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Activity\nHandout One. “On-site Response by Fire and Rescue During a Planned Electrical Outage”\nDescription of Site: The site is a Training and Research Area (TRA) complex. Maintenance work is planned in Building 648 which houses electrical equipment for the TRA complex. It is a two-level structure consisting of the ground-level floor, that contains switchgear, control panels, and power systems, and a basement level, that contains electrical cable trays.\nBuilding 648 is protected from fire by two systems, a dry pipe water sprinkler system and a carbon dioxide fire suppression system. A single fire panel controls both the high-pressure carbon dioxide and dry pipe fire suppression systems. When the system is activated, carbon dioxide is discharged from numerous nozzles in the ceiling of the ground level floor. Carbon dioxide is stored in fifty-five 100-pound bottles and its release will create an atmosphere within the building that is immediately dangerous to life and health.\nThere are several buildings besides Building 648 in the TRA Complex. About 700 yards from Building 648 is the TRA Emergency Control Center (ECC). The TRA ECC contains an emergency response truck housed in the garage on the south side of the ECC. The truck is equipped for emergency fire and rescue response, except that active equipment such as fire extinguishers and oxygen breathing apparatus are stored in racks to facilitate inspection, maintenance, and testing. The racks are in a storeroom on the north side of the ECC.\nDescription of Work: The work is to perform preventive maintenance activity on the Building 648 electrical switchgear including removal of 4160 volt electrical circuit breakers, vacuuming out breaker cubicles, inspecting ground straps, lubricating racking mechanisms, and basic inspections of the switchgear. The work is scheduled to start at 6 PM and conclude by the end of the shift at midnight. The work is scheduled after normal working hours and during the summer to minimize disruptions caused by the loss of power that would occur in conjunction with this work. The work needs to be complete by midnight so that various environmental protection systems can be restarted. All thirteen personnel assigned to the TRA Complex that shift are involved in the work activity: a Site Support Services foreman, a TRA foreman, seven electricians, two operators, a utilities operations supervisor, and a fire protection engineer.\nIn the past, preventive maintenance on these breakers was performed without de-energizing all sections of the 13,800 and 4160 volt buses, but rather by de-energizing only sections of the buses as they were being worked on. To enhance electrical safety during the preventive maintenance, the plan is to de-energize all buses at once when the work starts at 6 PM. In addition to Building 648, the power outage will impact several buildings in the TRA Complex, including the ECC.\nAdditional Information: The TRA Complex has seen decreased use in recent years. Operations for the TRA Complex faces tight budgets, often operating with a skeleton staff, especially when training and research demands are low during the summer months. Other relevant points to consider:\n\nThe operators are cross-trained to assist the fire protection engineer with emergency fire and rescue operations.\nTo minimize wear-and-tear and maximize availability of emergency equipment, the standing orders are that the fire truck should remain in its garage unless responding to an emergency.\nThe garage door on the west side of the ECC must be opened electrically. The manual back-up door operator has been out-of-service for six months. Repair parts are on order but are not expected to be delivered until November.\nThe ECC has a backup diesel generator on the east side of the garage. The generator requires 3 to 5 minutes to come up to speed and supply electrical loads.\nThe only communications available are radios and landline telephones. The landline telephones are considered highly reliable. The radios are reliable depending on atmospheric conditions, generally failing between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 times. Atmospheric conditions are expected to be favorable during the work.\nThe nearest off-site fire and rescue response is about 5 miles away and can be expected to respond within fifteen to twenty minutes, depending on traffic.\nWhen responding to an emergency involving an “immediately dangerous to life and health” atmosphere, a search-and-rescue efforts is considered successful when completed within five minutes, preferably within three minutes.\nWhen responding to a fire event, suppressing the fire within fifteen minutes is considered a successful response.\n\n\nProbabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Activity\nHandout Two: Small group assignment. Perform a PRA of emergency response during a planned electrical outage at the TRA Complex during work in Building 648. Guidelines for completing this exercise are:\n\nPick a group leader.\nPick a spokesman (may be but need not be the same as the leader)\nIdentify the Initiating Event. From Handout 1, the IE is “emergency fire and rescue response needed”.\nIdentify the decomposing nodes. For example, two decomposing nodes could be “call to respond to a fire” and “call to respond to a carbon dioxide activation (IDLH atmosphere)”.\nDevelop an outline of possible leaf nodes for each decomposing node. Consider basic questions:\n\nWho? On-site or offsite responders?\nWhat? Equipment needed\nWhere? Response location – Building 648 for IDLH atmosphere, TRA Complex for fire.\nWhen? Backshift, 6PM to Midnight.\nPossible failures, like communications glitch, equipment lost or breaks, personnel available, etc.\n\nDraft a fault tree for each decomposing node.\nResearch and assign probabilities for each leaf node. Considering breaking into subgroups for each decomposing node or otherwise dividing the leaf nodes up amongst the group to efficiently complete the fault tree.\nReassemble for peer review of the fault trees. Peer review is an essential part of the PRA process. Reach a consensus or final decision by the leader.\nLook for insights from the fault trees. Are any success paths too hard? Are the risks for any path unacceptable? Can alternate plans reduce the risk? Do the benefits of the alternatives outweigh their costs?\nThe spokesman drafts talking points summarizing the group’s conclusions and synthesizes group input for presentation at the next class."

Officials must govern based on the will of the people. Citizens influence government through elections, protests, petitions, and amendments. Articles I, II, V, and VII of the Constitution reflect this principle.\n- What are the issues?- How are people asking for change?- How does this show people oversee government?\n\n\nRepublicanism\nCitizens elect representatives to act on their behalf.\nIn a republic, voters choose leaders who make decisions for the public good. Representatives may act independently but risk losing office if they ignore public opinion. Article I, Section 2 outlines the election of House members.\n- What are the articles about?- Are the laws different depending on where you live?- How are they different?- Why is voting for representatives important?\n\n\nSeparation of Powers\nPower is divided among legislative, executive, and judicial branches.\nThe Constitution assigns distinct roles to each branch: Congress makes laws (Article I), the President enforces them (Article II), and the courts interpret them (Article III). Shared powers, like treaty approval, require cooperation between branches.\n- What is the issue?- What role does each branch play on this issue?- How does it demonstrate “separation”?\n\n\nChecks and Balances\nEach branch can limit the powers of the others.\nCongress makes laws, but the President can veto them. Congress can override vetoes. The President nominates judges, but the Senate confirms them. Courts can declare laws unconstitutional. This system prevents any one branch from becoming too powerful.\n- What is the issue?- How does each branch check or balance the other?- How does this issue demonstrate checks and balances?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Idea\nCore Idea\nExplanation\nStudent Prompts\n\n\n\n\nLimited Government\nGovernment power is restricted to protect individual rights.\nOfficials must act within the bounds of the Constitution. Congress can only pass laws within its enumerated powers. The Executive must enforce laws as written. Courts can strike down laws or actions that exceed constitutional limits. Federalist No. 78 reinforces this principle.\n- What is the issue?- Who is on each side?- What do they want?- Where is the line for limited government?- How does this relate to “Checks and Balances”?\n\n\nFederalism\nPower is shared between national and state/local governments.\nThe federal government governs national issues; states and localities handle local concerns. The Supremacy Clause (Article VI) ensures federal law prevails in conflicts. Federalist No. 45 explains the balance of powers. Laws vary by location, reflecting local needs and values.\n- What is the issue?- Are the laws different depending on where you live?- How are they different?- Why are the laws different?\n\n\n\nThe following handouts are used in this activity: 1. Separation of Powers 2. Republicanism 3. Federalism 4. Limited Government 5. Popular Sovereignty 6.

How did the news articles illustrate this principle in action?\nWhat surprised you or challenged your assumptions? Did the articles present perspectives you hadn’t considered?\nHow did your group reach consensus on the meaning or impact of the articles? What disagreements or different interpretations emerged?\nWhat civic values were at stake in the issues you analyzed? How do these values relate to your own beliefs or experiences?\nWhat questions remain unanswered? What would you want to ask the people involved in the articles?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat experiences or values might shape someone’s view of this issue differently than yours? How can understanding those perspectives deepen civic engagement?\nHow did your group balance evidence and empathy in your discussion? Were there moments of debate, discussion, or dialogue?\nWhat role should citizens play in shaping government decisions on this issue? What actions could you take to engage with this topic?\n\n### Debate-Focused Prompts - What constitutional principle was most contested in your issue—and how did different sides justify their positions? (Encourages students to identify how constitutional ideas are used to support conflicting arguments.) - Which arguments presented in the articles were most persuasive—and why? (Promotes analysis of rhetorical strategies, use of evidence, and logical reasoning.) - If you had to argue for the side you personally disagree with, how would you build a case using constitutional principles? (Builds empathy and deepens understanding of opposing views.) - What role should debate play in resolving civic disagreements—and what are its limits? (Encourages reflection on the purpose and impact of civic debate in a democratic society.) - How did your group handle disagreement during your discussion? Did you shift toward debate, discussion, or dialogue—and what was most effective? (Helps students evaluate their own discourse strategies and group dynamics.)\n\n\n\n\nWhat evidence from the articles helped your group understand the constitutional principle more clearly—and how did you decide what was most relevant? (Encourages students to reflect on how they selected and interpreted information.)\nHow did your group navigate different interpretations of the same article or issue? What strategies helped you reach a shared understanding? (Promotes metacognition and collaborative reasoning.)\nWhat connections did you find between your Big Idea and other groups’ presentations? How do these principles interact in real civic life? (Encourages synthesis across constitutional ideas.)\nWhat questions did your group raise that remain unanswered—and how might you investigate them further? (Supports curiosity and future civic engagement.)\nHow did your group ensure that all voices were heard during discussion? What made the conversation productive or challenging? (Builds awareness of group dynamics and inclusive discourse.)"

The introduction includes an outline of the overall presentation, briefly describing each part and clarifying fundamental concepts as needed.\nIntroduction is well-crafted but does not successfully grab and hold audience’s attention. The promised attention-grabber is subsequently underdeveloped or missing content in the body of the presentation. Examples fail to fully connect to the thesis. The introduction includes an outline of all elements of the overall presentation, but without depth.\nThere is an introduction attempted, but the execution is poor giving the audience no real sense of what to expect from the presentation. Parts missing, such as an outline not being comprehensive or failure to clarify key elements.\n10%\n\n\nOrganization\nPresentation is well organized and flows smoothly. Transitions are succinct and points are connected. Information is presented in a logical sequence that is easy to follow. Prepared and distributed appropriate handouts/PowerPoints (if applicable). Stayed within the allotted time limits for presentation and Q&A.\nPresentation is generally well organized with transitions between key points. Most of the information was presented in a logical sequence. Handouts not well prepared or not distributed. Appeared to rush or lag to meet time requirements.\nOrganizational structure is not easily followed by the audience or is not presented in a logical sequence. Transitions between key points are lacking. Required handouts were either missing or poorly done.

Evaluates existing information and provides a constructive analysis. The argument is clear, logical, and amply supported.\nInformation is substantially accurate. Some analysis is provided. Evidence is provided based solely on case law. The argument is logical and adequately supported.\nInformation relied upon contains inaccuracies, mistakes of law and/or mistakes of fact. Key facts may have been omitted. Information not supported by case law. Little or no evaluation or analysis.\n40%\n\n\nPresentation Style\nPoised, articulate, appropriate volume, steady pace, uses inflection. Pronunciation is correct and clear. Appropriate word choice and grammar. Absence of linguistic blunder. Appropriate eye contact, gestures and movement. Refers to notes but does not read from them. Appearance and attire were appropriate.\nArticulate but not polished. Word choice and grammar use is mostly correct and appropriate. Speaks in full sentences with minimal hesitation or unnecessary verbal pauses. Flows. Appearance was neat.\nSpeaker appears unsure or awkward. Volume, pace, or inflection cause presentation to sound choppy. Distracting use of pause words interrupts the flow. Poor eye contact, overuse of hand gesture or movement, or wooden in appearance. Over reliance on written notes. Attire was not appropriate.\n20%\n\n\nConclusion\nEnds with an accurate conclusion, demonstrating a thoughtful, strong evaluation of the evidence presented with insightful observations. No new or confusing information is addressed. Takes and answers questions from the instructor and students appropriately.\nEnds with a summary of main points showing some evaluation of the evidence presented. Asks for questions.\nEnds with a summary but little or no evaluation. New or confusing information is presented. Does not ask for questions or provides weak responses to questions.\n10%"

    "text": "Civic Leadership Self-Assessment\nThis self-assessment is designed to help you reflect on your civic identity and leadership development. It is based on a four-domain framework that includes: Public Service Motivation, Democratic Accountability, Political Astuteness, and Public Value Orientation.\n\n\nInstructions\nRate each of the following statements on a scale from 1 to 5:\n1 – Strongly Disagree | 2 – Disagree | 3 – Neutral | 4 – Agree | 5 – Strongly Agree\n\n\nSelf-Assessment Statements\n\nPublic Service Motivation: I am driven by a deep commitment to serve others and contribute to the public good.\nDemocratic Accountability: I consider how my actions affect public trust and strive to ensure transparency.\nPolitical Astuteness: I can navigate diverse perspectives and build coalitions across differences.\nPublic Value Orientation:** I think beyond efficiency and consider what outcomes truly benefit society.\n\n\n\nReflection Prompts\n\nWhat experience or value has most shaped your desire to serve others?\nWhen have you had to take responsibility for decisions that affected others? What did you learn?\nHow do you typically respond to conflict or disagreement in group settings?\nIdentify one issue in your community or discipline where you’d like to make a difference.\n\n\n\nInterpreting Your Results\nDomain-by-Domain Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore Range\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n1–2\nYou may have limited awareness or experience in this area. Consider opportunities for growth, such as observing civic leaders, engaging in group projects, or learning about this competency through coursework or service.\n\n\n3\nYou are developing awareness but may not yet consistently act on it. Reflect on what experiences might help you strengthen this competency.\n\n\n4-5\nYou demonstrate a strong orientation in this area. Think about how you can build on this strength to contribute to civic efforts or mentor others.\n\n\n\nPublic Service Motivation – Reflects your internal commitment to serve others and advance the public good. Democratic Accountability – Reflects your attention to public trust, transparency, and responsiveness in decision-making. Political Astuteness – Reflects your ability to navigate diverse viewpoints, build consensus, and lead ethically in complex environments. Public Value Orientation – Reflects your consideration of how your work or leadership contributes meaningfully to societal benefit.\nSummary Profile Interpretation - High across all domains (scores of 4–5): You likely see yourself as a civic-minded leader and may already be active in community or organizational leadership. Consider ways to deepen or apply your leadership across public contexts. - Mixed scores (some 4–5, others 1–3): You may be strong in certain areas but have opportunities for development in others. Use your strengths to build confidence while targeting growth areas through service, dialogue, or academic challenges. - Lower scores (mostly 1–3): This may indicate you’re at the beginning of your civic leadership journey. That’s completely okay—use this reflection as a starting point to explore new ways of thinking about leadership, responsibility, and impact.\nRegardless of your results, this activity is about self-awareness—not judgment. The goal is to help you recognize your leadership potential and begin shaping how you want to contribute to your community and field."

For the optional second part of the assignment, students will participate in an online budget hearing session that usually lasts for one hour, reflect on the experience, and answer a few questions. The instructor may choose to include a brief in-class discussion following the assignment.\nClass Size: The assignment can be done by individual students or by small groups of 2-3 students. The recommended total number of students (if individual work) or student groups is 6-10."

Through this process, you will understand the main components of a government budget, practice searching for and identifying relevant information from a large document, as well as synthesize and communicate findings.\nTask: Skim through the budget. Pay close attention to the budget summary (if there is one) and the main table reporting on total revenue and total spending. Because budget documents are often very long, it is a good idea to start with the table of contents and identify the summary section/table that may contain the headline numbers. For the last question on the budgeted spending for specific purposes, use the search function (ctrl + F) to search for key words and identify relevant sections of the document.\nWrite a short, one-page memo identifying your observations. Write the memo from the perspective of an analyst for a local interest group, which may be the local chamber of commerce or a trade group. Your memo should discuss:\n\nThe entity and documents you reference (include a link to the budget documents.\nThe size of the budget, that is, planned total spending. List the page number where you find such information. Moreover, is the budget balanced?\nThe major components of spending (policy areas that are funded) and major sources of revenue. List the page number where you find such information.\nAnticipated changes in total spending from the previous year. List the page number where you find such information.\n[Customized for each course: here we use cybersecurity as an example.] Does the budget explicitly address the issue of cybersecurity, if so, in what way? Can you identify how much money is appropriated for the purpose of enhancing cybersecurity of government functions or implementing cybersecurity policies in the community?\n\nGrading criteria: activity-based grading. By addressing all issues listed above, you will receive full points for answering all questions, not based on the accuracy of your answers."

In this part of the assignment, you will participate in the online public hearing session to see public participation in government policymaking in action.\nTask: You will answer four questions, two prior to the hearing and two after the hearing. When all four questions are completed, you will post your responses on a discussion forum thread to share with the rest of the class. After reading about each other’s experience and observations, we will discuss in class the value of public participation in government budgeting and the opportunities for improving public participation.\n\nPre-hearing:\n1.1. What are the major issues faced by the government that you think should be addressed at the budget hearing?\n1.2. If you were to ask one question or make one comment at the hearing, what would that be? In addition, explain the perspective from which you are raising the question/comment: individual resident, representative of a local interest group, etc.\nPost-hearing:\n2.1. Were the “major issues” you had identified actually discussed at the hearing? If yes, who initiated such discussions?\n2.2. What is the one observation you would make based on the hearing? The observation could be on your question/comment if you actually raised it, or on other aspects of public participation in the budget process.\n\nGrading criteria: activity-based grading. By addressing all issues listed above, you will receive full points for answering all questions, not based on the accuracy of your answers.\nThis activity guide was developed as part of a collaborative initiative between the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service and the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) Faculty Development team.

Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service and the Center for Teaching Excellence worked with faculty to create new OER materials available to all faculty and staff. These free materials are designed to engage students by introducing innovative cross-discipline classroom activities/assignments that foster civic learning.\nWe believe every college graduate—whether in social sciences, the arts, humanities, business, or STEM —should be prepared to engage as an active citizen. This project aims to provide resources for faculty across disciplines to prepare students with the skills and motivations needed to work to make a difference in the quality of life in the community, through both political and non-political processes.\nActivities or assignments will create opportunities for students to use academic skills in civic contexts, for example, analyzing an issue or policy, or communicating complex issues (scientific, economic, etc.) to public audiences."
