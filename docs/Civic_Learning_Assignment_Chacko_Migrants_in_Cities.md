Civic Learning Assignment Guide

# Migrant Inclusion and Integration in Cities

**Creator:** Elizabeth Chacko, Professor, Geography and Environment.

**Original Class Context:** GEOG 1000, Migrants in the City.

**Purpose:** This assignment on the inclusion of migrants in cities fosters critical understanding of social integration, urban policy, and equity, equipping students to analyze and propose inclusive solutions for diverse urban communities. 

**Activity Type:** Class exercise and group discussion.

**Time:** This is an in-class assignment and can be completed in an hour and 15 minutes. However, it can also be converted into a research paper.

**Class Size:** Recommended number of students for in-class exercise: 15-25 students. 

## **Learning Objectives**

By completing this assignment, students will demonstrate an ability to:

* **Explain** the differences between migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons, including their legal definitions and rights.  
* **Analyze** real-world case studies of inclusion and integration of migrants and refugees in different cities, highlighting how these inclusion and integration strategies align with human rights laws.   
* **Reflect** on the ethical, social, and political dimensions of migration and migrant inclusion in urban settings.

# **Task Instructions**

1. Read about the difference between refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons and migrants before coming to class:

[https://www.rescue.org/article/migrants-asylum-seekers-refugees-and-immigrants-whats-difference](https://www.rescue.org/article/migrants-asylum-seekers-refugees-and-immigrants-whats-difference)

2. “What do you think are the needs of migrants in a city? (10 minutes)

Select 10 icons for goods, amenities, services or even intangible things that you think migrants need when they have newly arrived in a city, using the link below: 

[https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/free](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/free)

Share the 10 icons you selected with your partner and tell them why you chose them. Under what broad categories would you place the icons you selected?

3. Newly arrived migrants have needs but we also should consider migrants’ human rights. Which of the goods, amenities and services you collectively chose (there will be overlaps with your partner) would you consider migrant needs, migrant rights or both? (10 \-15 minutes to confer, report out and discuss)

4. Along with your partner, find what your allocated city (e.g. Chicago, Baltimore, Denver, Nashville etc.) is doing to better include and integrate migrants in the areas we highlighted in our discussion. You should base your findings on at least two scholarly sources, two popular press sources and two city government sources. Are any of the policies or strategies used by your allocated city innovative (was the city a pioneer in using a policy or strategy? Could the policy be used by other cities?  
     
5. What can universities and college students do to be more inclusive of migrants? How has GW (through academic programming, volunteering and internship opportunities, etc.) made the campus, neighborhood and the city more inclusive for migrants? 

# Criteria for Success

* This class assignment is designed for developing a better understanding of how cities can play a critical role in migrant inclusion. It takes into account migrants’ needs and rights.  If the students in the class were collectively able to address all the pertinent issues (socio-cultural inclusion, economic inclusion, access to health care and education, political inclusion etc.), I would consider the exercise a success.

# Additional Notes for the Instructor

* The assignment can be converted into a research paper that requires the student to delve into the scholarly literature as well as the empirical data provided by individual cities as a case study. For this, I have provided a rubric.
