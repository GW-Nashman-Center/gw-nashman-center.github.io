Civic Learning Activity Guide

# Resiliency Shoebox

**Creator:** Sandy Hoar, Assistant Clinical Professor, Physician Assistant Studies; Global Health

**Purpose:** This is a simulation activity to help with the prevention of despair and the encouragement of resiliency after a climate emergency, such as an unusual flooding or a spreading fire. Students will think about and develop tools, supports, and actions that can help them, their family, and their community emerge confident, courageous, and better able to withstand, and even grow, from a crisis.

**Activity Type:** Simulation and group discussion

**Time:** This is designed as a one-time 4-hour activity, not including breaks, but can be modified to about 2 hours 15 minutes, not including any concluding information or breaks.

**Class Size:** This is designed for a class of 12-18 students, in three small groups, but can be increased to include more students, though then will take longer to complete.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

* List at least one barrier to a community committee trying to promote resiliency  
* Identify at least one step that a community committee can take to begin developing solutions to prevent panic  
* Describe at least one step to create a project that encourages resiliency  
* Develop a beginning plan to encourage community buy-in

# Pre-Activity Preparation

## Instructor: Required Materials & Set up

* Room set-up:

* Arrange for multiple round tables, seating for 4-6 per table.  This is adaptable but the best minimum is 3 tables.    
* Timer—usually the teacher  
* Flip chart or multiple white boards, visible to all the tables with black and very brightly colored markers.  Someone to record themes presented from each table. Can be the teacher but better is a separate person.  
* Each table will be given 1 scenario to discuss, 3 total-- a different scenario for each table.  If there are more than 3 tables, more than 1 table can have the same scenario.  Each scenario is the same, with the same questions to answer, but from the point of view of a different community committee.  
* Print the 3 different scenarios, enough for 1 per table (see: Appendix B)  
* Print 1 copy per student of the “Resiliency Shoebox Activity—Student Sheet.” (see: Appendix C)  
* Print 1 copy per student of the “Student Evaluation.” (see: Appendix D)

# Activity Instructions

| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5-10 mins | Introduction & Engagement (see Appendix A) Introduce definition of resiliency Present the goal of the activity and the logistics/timing | Listen and ask clarifying questions |
| 30-60 mins | Small group discussion Pass out the scenarios (see Appendix B) Coach students as they discuss the scenarios | Review the provided scenario and discuss the questions |
| 30-60 mins | Group presentations Have Group 1 (table 1\) read their scenario, the first question, and their response, while the chart facilitator records the responses (see below).  Then Group 2 with their scenario, the first question, and their response.  Finally Group 3 with their scenario, the first question, and their response. Repeat the above steps for each group (table) and each question.  Note: This may seem slower than having each group report all 4 questions then moving to the next table but part of the point is that even though each group is composed of a very different mix of members, the answers are often the same or similar and it is easier to focus when each table is reporting their response to the same question.  | Each group presents their answers One or a few students can be the flip chart facilitator. Notes: This is not a facilitator as far as participating in the groups but someone who records the answers and then draws connecting lines and colors, recording, identifying and pointing out similarities between groups, as responses are listed by each group.  They can use abbreviations, a cartoon, or a word, and different colors to signify similarities of themes between the groups.  They do not need to speak at all as everyone will be able to see the progress.  They can answer questions for points that are unclear on why they, upon hearing responses, categorized responses as similar. |
| 15-30 mins | Debrief/Reflection Provide concluding thoughts and key takeaways. General discussion can involve noticing the similarities and differences between the groups.  Especially important is the initial step and the suggestions for future activities.   Direct students to complete the individual reflection and evaluation (see Appendix D) | Individual journal prompts and sharing Complete the evaluation |

# Assessment & Evaluation

Formative Assessment

* While students discuss the scenarios, rotate through the room to listen for evidence-based reasoning and ask questions to encourage deeper thinking.

Summative Assessment

* Students submit responses to the journal questions and/or evaluation questions

# Additional Notes for the Instructor

* Usually what happens is that though very different scenarios, the initial barriers and initial steps, and possible next activities are similar, for example identifying the extent of the problem, including more people with different opinions or stakes, starting small and building on success, starting to work more regionally, etc.

### **Appendix A: Introduction to Read to Students**

Resiliency is the capacity to withstand, adapt and recover from difficulties; it can include mental, physical, and emotional flexibility.  It can apply to an individual, a family or a community.

Goal: The goal of this activity is to think about and develop tools, supports, and actions that can help you, your family and your community emerge confident, courageous, and better able to withstand, and even grow from a crisis.  It also will empower you to become an advocate and activist for your community. 

This is a future-based simulation dealing with the prevention of despair and the encouragement of resiliency in your family and community, after a climate emergency, of any type, for example flooding.  Each table has a different scenario but each takes place in 2028 where your committee (your table) has just won a prize for your recent success. You are celebrating your success and thinking about the steps that led to it.  Since it is in the future there are no problems with money or regulations or the impossibility of completion—you have already accomplished it.  Also, since it is in the future, if you decide that you needed some science or technology product, not currently available, no problem.  It has already been developed—maybe by your committee. 

One person at each table needs to read the scenario and ask the first question.  Someone needs to record the major thoughts/responses. After time is called, continue to question 2, etc.

You will have (? minutes) for the first question then (? minutes) for each of the remaining questions. (the teacher will announce times up for each question) 

Each group will then present their answers and the results from the different groups will be compared.

### **Appendix B: Table Scenarios for Students**

Table 1: You are a small committee of church members who came together because of concern about climate crises.  The year is 2028\.

* Identify at least 1 step that a community committee can take to begin developing solutions to prevent panic  
* Describe at least 1 step to create a project that encourages resiliency  
* Develop a beginning plan to encourage community buy-in

**Journaling:** Prompts for journaling—Use one or more of these prompts to help you think about today’s activity or form and answer your own prompts.  You may want to share your thoughts with others in the class.

1. Do you think you could organize a small committee in your community to discuss some aspect of resiliency and climate crises?  Would you include members with the same interests or varied interests?  What would be your first step?  
2. What aspect of resiliency would be the easiest to tackle first?  
3. Think about what was helpful for you in previous times of distress.  How can you use that to help you respond effectively to new difficult situations?  How can a community do this?   
4. Describe how you might implement activities to increase your personal, family and/or community resiliency ahead of another climate or weather emergency?   
5. Isolation is a frequent response to stress, as is catastrophizing difficulties or assuming the world is out to get you.  How can you use today’s activity to help form connections, foster self-worth and develop social supports to reduce anxiety, depression or irrational thinking?   
6. What aspects of this activity did you find interesting?  
7. What aspects of this activity seemed the most unrealistic or difficult to implement?  
8. How did today’s activity help you to think about breaking down big problems into manageable pieces?
