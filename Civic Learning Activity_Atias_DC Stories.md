Civic Learning Activity Guide

# DC Stories

**Creator: Daphna Atias (Educational Developer, GW Center for Teaching Excellence)**

**Original Class Context:** CCAS 1001: First-Year Experience

**Purpose:** Students will reflect on their relationship to Washington, DC, then learn about community-engaged participatory research methods and use them to think about how different people experience the city. 

**Activity Type:** In-class group discussion based on brief homework activity

**Time:** Multiple sessions: 20 minutes to introduce during one class session, then homework, then 50 minutes in a subsequent class session 

**Class Size:** Students work in small groups of 3-4. This activity will be used in a class of 18 but can easily scale up or down with changes in how students share out

*Note:* This lesson is designed for CCAS 1001, the first-year experience course required of all students entering GW’s Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. By this point in the semester, students have reflected on their own experiences leading up to college and viewed an exhibit on GW’s history. A new lesson in Fall 2025 invites students to situate themselves within the District rather than just the campus. The initial design of this lesson focused more on students’ own exploration—where they’ve gone so far, what they’d like to do. The goal of this civic-engagement-minded lesson plan is to get students thinking about how factors like race, gender, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, etc. affect people’s experiences of the city. Students’ exploration will begin with two tasks:

* Gaining perspective by visiting the GW Museum’s exhibit on the history of transportation in DC (the exhibit largely focuses on pre-20th-century history)  
* Taking a photo that tells a story about access to transportation

The biggest challenge of this activity, which takes place in one class meeting of a weekly 50-minute course, is what students do with their questions. The course structure doesn’t allow for a deep or complete exploration. So, in essence, while students are learning about the importance of community-engaged methods of research, they can’t implement them and risk undermining the very ethos the lesson is attempting to promote. Nevertheless, the hope is that students gain knowledge of what ethical participatory research looks like and emerge more attuned to their own identities and to how power, privilege, accessibility, and intersectionality affect how people navigate their surroundings. 

The basic frame for this lesson could be adapted to many contexts. At its simplest, the structure of noticing something, taking a photo to represent it, and reflecting on it is broadly applicable in a number of disciplines (I was inspired by an assignment in a sociology class that asks students to photograph something in a courthouse that could be useful to crime victims). Expanded over a longer timeframe, a course could dive into several pieces of the [community-engaged methods](https://www.urban.org/projects/cem-toolkit) protocol, perhaps as part of a [course-based undergraduate research experience](https://our.charlotte.edu/faculty/course-based-undergraduate-research-experience-cure/). The community could be a constituency on campus (transfer students, first-gen students, etc.) or nearby.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

* Reflect on their own emerging DC stories  
* Examine the factors that shape people’s experiences of places  
* Describe key principles of community-engaged research methods  
* Practice designing community-engaged research questions

# Pre-Activity Preparation

## Student: Required Prerequisite Knowledge/Skills

* There are no prerequisites to this activity

## Instructor: Required Materials & Set up

* Ability to project the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15WftMeB4hJZFVK4un5C2lvWk94vlKYKpXzVthD-ke_U/edit?slide=id.g37420a3d670_0_1#slide=id.g37420a3d670_0_1); instructors can also create a handout instead  
* Groups will refer to the [community-engaged methods infographic](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/Community-Engaged%20Methods%20Model.pdf); instructors should print a copy for each student or ensure students can access it digitally

## Accessibility Considerations

* The homework associated with this activity asks students to visit the GW Museum and take a photograph. The museum is designed to be accessible, and students can contact [museuminfo@gwu.edu](mailto:museuminfo@gwu.edu) with questions. This activity could also be effective without a museum visit.  
* Students who do not have access to a photographic device may describe an image instead. Visually impaired students may need to share a verbal description instead of a photograph and prompt their partners to provide a verbal description  
* Slides are designed using a template that incorporates best practices for accessibility and usability   
* When presenting, instructors can [turn on captions](https://library.gwu.edu/accessible-presentations)  
* The in-class activity asks students to raise hands and move around the room and may need to be adjusted based on available space and mobility considerations

# Activity Instructions

## Initial class session: 20-25 minutes at end of class

| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8 mins | DC terminology: engage students by asking which terms they’re familiar with, or what they would add to the list | Weigh in on knowledge and curiosity about DC terms |
| 12-15 mins | *Decide whether to facilitate a discussion or an activity (like a gallery walk or poll with up-voting) Decide whether to use small groups or a whole-class format* Address the following questions: How have you interacted with DC so far? What do you want to explore? | Participate in discussion |
| 2 mins | Explain homework | Listen actively |

## 

## Homework

| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \~1 hour (for students) | Post hours and information for GW Museum on course site | Visit [From A to DC: Transportation in Washington exhibit at GW museum](https://museum.gwu.edu/dc-transportation-washington) |
| \~10 mins  | Post prompt for photograph assignment | Take a photograph based on this prompt: In your daily travels around Foggy Bottom, the Vern, or any other part of the region, take a picture you think tells us something about access to transportation in DC. It could be a flyer, a sign, a piece of infrastructure, etc. Please be respectful about what you choose to photograph. Be prepared to talk about what you noticed, why you chose this picture, and what questions the image raises for you. |

| 20-25 mins | Introducing community-engaged methods Engage students by asking them about agency in their lives Frame the ongoing question: how can we use community-engaged and participatory methods to support people making decisions about their lives and advocate for what they need? Share [infographic](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/Community-Engaged%20Methods%20Model.pdf): give students time to read, process, and discuss | Respond to reflective prompts about agency in decision-making; carefully read the infographic; participate in discussion about the graphic |

# Assessment & Evaluation

This assignment is intended as a formative activity. Instructors could monitor students’ engagement by:

* Asking students to post their photos and reflections to a discussion board in addition to or instead of discussing the photo with a peer in class   
* Circulating around the room to listen to students’ conversations, answer questions, and prompt students

### **Additional Resources**

The Urban Institute’s wonderful series of [toolkits on community-engaged and participatory methods](https://www.urban.org/projects/cem-toolkit) can seed many ideas for expanding this project. A [positionality statement](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/exploring-individual-and-institutional-positionality) would be a logical next assignment.

The [Nashman Center’s](https://serve.gwu.edu) resources support instructors and students interested in civic engagement.
