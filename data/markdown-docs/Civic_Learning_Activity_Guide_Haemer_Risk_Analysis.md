# Gaining Practical Insights From Risk Analysis


**Creator:** Robert Budd Haemer, Adjunct Professor, GW Law School

**Original Class Context:** LW 6459, Atomic Energy Law

**Purpose:** This activity introduces Probabilistic Risk Assessment, a tool for informing decisions by quantifiably comparing risk to the benefit by providing risk insights.

**Activity Type:** Student presentations, based on a homework problem that can be performed individually or in small groups (preferred)

**Time:** 15 minutes for presentation of topic in first class. Then, 15-25 minutes to discuss the homework assignment in the next following class.  Group spokesperson should lead a discussion of insights from homework (about five minutes for each group).

**Class Size:** Recommended number of participants is 15-25 students, breaking into small groups of 4-5 students for the homework, resulting in 3-5 groups for the follow up class discussions.


# Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
- Explain the key elements of a PRA; Initiating Event, Decomposing Node, Leaf Node.
- Compare risks to identify which actions have the highest value in contributing to successful outcomes in response to an Initiating Event


# Pre-Activity Preparation

## Student: Required Prerequisite Knowledge/Skills

- Review guidance from the U.S. Nuclear Regulator Commission on using risk in regulatory decision-making, see link: [Concepts Of Risk | NRC.gov](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/risk-informed/concept.html)


## Instructor: Required Materials & Set up

- Adopt handout material if appropriate for the course
- Make copies of the two handouts, enough for each student
- PowerPoint presentation on projection
- Determine the number of small groups and time limit for presentations to target the duration of the second day for twenty minutes.  Communicate time limits for presentations to students.


## Accessibility Considerations

- Identify suitably accessible small group work space if needed
- The PowerPoint slides can be translated as needed


# Activity Instructions

## Initial Class Session: 15 minutes at end of class


| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **2 mins** | Introduction & Engagement <br><br> • The purpose of lecture is to introduce a quantitative approach to managing risk <br><br> • Relate risk management to course subject <br><br> • While it is cool to be like Han Solo and exclaim, "Never tell me the odds", but what we all want is to know how to improve the odds of success. |  Students ask clarifying questions |
| **5 mins** | History of PRA <br><br> • Instructor covers history or PRA <br><br> • Poses questions about the difference between deterministic rules and probabilistic insights from assigned reading | Students respond to instructor questions based on review of the background about PRA provided on NRC website |
| **8 mins** | Build a PRA <br><br> • Instructor explains two examples of fault trees | Students should ask questions about how to estimate probability of failure of a leaf node |



## Homework

| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Homework 60 mins | Homework <br><br> • Instructor helps students pick small groups | Follow the instructions in the handouts to draft a sample PRA and gather risk assessment insights |


## Dedicated Class Session: 15-25 minutes for presentations

| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Day Two 3-5 mins per group | Debrief/Reflection <br><br> • Facilitate classroom discussion of learnings by each group from the homework | Spokesperson of each small group will lead a discussion of the group’s insights from the PRA exercise |


## Assessment & Evaluation

Formative Assessment
- Qualitive assessment of student engagement with a complex STEM subject
- Group leader reports for second class to determine effective of group engagement and building risk communication skills.


Summative Assessment (if applicable)
- Oral presentation (see attached rubric)
- 100 points spread in 5 competencies: Introduction, Organization, Content, Style, and Conclusion


# Additional Notes for the Instructor

- In the slides, the speaker notes are for the instructor.  They are not intended to be shared with the students.
- The homework exercise is based on a worker safety event.  Concern for occupational safety and health may be adapted into most courses.  If the instructor feels another scenario would be more appropriate, the author of this activity can help adapt another exercise specific to the course.


# Supplemental Materials

Handouts & Slides
- Power Point slides to facilitate activity in class
- Handout for students
- Rubric for oral presentation
