# How do corporations spend in politics?

**Creator**: Thomas Choate, Teaching Assistant Professor, Strategic Management & Public Policy, GW School of Business

**Original Class Context**: BADM 2001 Markets and Politics

**Purpose**: This activity will increase students' civic knowledge of corporate involvement in the U.S. political system, enabling them to assess how corporations engage through elections, trade associations, and other means.

**Activity Type**: Small group research task

**Time**: 50 to 75 minutes

**Class Size**: Sufficient to form (ideally, at least four) small groups of 4-5 students

For classes smaller than 20, student pairs or individuals students can complete a scaled-down version of the activity.


# Learning Objectives:

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
- Identify a S&P 500 company's level of political disclosure with CPA-Zicklin Index
- Use corporations' political  engagement reports and [OpenSecrets.org](http://opensecrets.org) to assess individually and compare across corporations:
    - How much and what types of corporate political activity are disclosed
    - How much and what types of corporate political activity are pursued
    - Who are a corporation's potential allies in the U.S Congress
 

# Pre-Activity Preparation

## Student: Required Prerequisite Knowledge/Skills
- Students should have a basic knwoledge of the U.S. political system including the two major political parties, the legislative role of Congress and state/district geographic election of its members, and that election campaigns are in-part funded through private contributions.
- Ideally, students should be familiar with many major corporations and their industries, or at least the type of products and services they sell.
- To understand the CPA-Zicklin Index, students should be familiar with and able to read/interpret an index or ranking of companies or organizations, e.g, knowledge of university rankings should suffice.
- Read:

## Instructor: Required Materials & Set up
- No physical materials are required, unless technology constraints below apply.
- Instructor computer, internet access, and a projector are needed for part of the activity.
    - If not available, distribute a physical copy of the political engagement report for Visa to each group.
- Student computer, internet, and Google docs access is ideal.
    - If not available, distribute a physical copy of the political engagement report for a different assigned company and the two worksheets to each group. Or, let the groups choose (in order by lots, etc.) from a set of varied company reports you have printed in advance.


## Accessibility Considerations
- Students who use a screenreader may do so and should bring headphones. Fortunately, political engagement reports often include only text and tables, Unfortunately, some political engagement reports, especially in pdf, may lack accessibility features to enable successful use of screenreaders and other tools.
- Groups with students with social disabilities may require additional instructor guidance on assignment of roles and tasks to each student.
- Especially for international students less familiar with how US corporations spend politically and the terms used, the How Companies Spend webpage in the assigned readings defines technical terms of different types of spending. The [full CPA-Zicklin Index](https://www.politicalaccountability.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-CPA-Zicklin-Index.pdf) provides more detailed descriptions.


# Activity Instructions

| Time     | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **10 mins** | **Introduction & Engagement**<br><br>• Corporations can use their funds to try to influence elections and policy. While contributions to federal election campaigns by corporate political action committees (PACs) must be disclosed, some spending is not legally required to be disclosed to the public. Who do you think imposes tighter restrictions on their political spending and voluntarily discloses more: the tech industry or finance? Within industries: Ford or Tesla? Meta or Google? JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America?<br><br>• This activity will ask you to research **[collaboratively in small groups]** the political spending of a single major corporation and then to make comparisons with others.<br><br>• Beyond a broader appreciation of how corporations seek to influence U.S. politics, you will also better understand differences between companies in their spending, disclosure, and potential allies in the U.S. Congress, providing one component of a tool for predicting which companies will achieve their political objectives. | Provide guesses and reasoning for their predictions of how industries and companies differ in their political spending and disclosure.<br><br> Ask questions if any part is unclear. |
| **15 mins** | **CPA-Zicklin Index and walkthrough of a political engagement report / OpenSecrets**<br><br>• Present pages 7–8 of the 2024 CPA-Zicklin Index (in Appendix A), and ask “What makes a company a CPA-Zicklin Trendsetter?”<br> ◦ Review of Pre-class Reading 2 and the index notions: disclosure of spending (items #1–7) and internal governance / external oversight over political spending (items #8–24).<br><br>• Present page 42 of the Index, including how Trendsetters scored on each item; zero in on Visa Inc., noting the answer “Y[es]” to items #1–7. Then, walk through the Visa political engagement report (in Appendix A), asking students the differences between direct corporations contributions of $1.21 million (p. 11), Visa PAC contributions of $746,000 (p. 16), and trade association dues that support industry lobbying of $1.61M (p. 5). [Alternatively, choose a company relevant to your course with "Y[es]" or "N[ot] A[pplicable]" in those seven columns. The report may be found by web searching for "[company name] political management report."] <br><br> • As some companies do not report PAC disbursements in their political engagement reports, show [Visa Inc's PAC profile](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/equality-pac/C00365122/summary/2024) on OpenSecrets and compare the ease of finding information here (e.g., partisan composition) to the Visa's report. Ask students to predict and to explain whether Visa's PAC gives more to Republican or Democratic campaigns. <br><br> • Time permitting, ask students to suggest other companies and predict the partisan lean of their PAC disbursements. Note, not all corporations have a PAC. <br><br> • Finally, show [Visa's lobbying page](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2024&id=D000029689) on OpenSecrets. Ask students what issues Visa might want to lobby on, before showing the "bills" tab. Ask whether Visa spends more lobbying or on elections? Why? <br><br>  • Indicate that students will now form small groups and investigate the political activity of another company. | Answer what corporate disclosures matter to the CPA-Zicklin Index and why.<br><br> Discuss the differences between these types of political spending.<br><br> Predict the partisan lean of companies’ PAC contributions. <br><br> Ask questions if any part is unclear. |
| **5 mins** | Formation of student groups and roles <br><br> • Form groups of 4 or 5 students. (If you already have ongoing student groups in your class, use those.) <br><br> • Each group should have a collector / reporter of information, and two students assigned to information in OpenSecrets and two to information in the political engagement report. <br><br> • Assign or have each group choose a company from the Trensetters or First Tier and ensure they can find (1) the 2024 political engagement report, (2) the OpenSecrets PAC profile, and (3) the OpenSecrets lobbying profile for the company. <br><br> • Develop a list of the companies students are researching to ensure each group has a different company and consider good industry pairings of companies for later. | Form groups and adopt roles. <br><br> Choose a company and ensure the relevant sources are available, <br><br> Ask questions if any part is unclear. |
| **25 - 30 mins** | Student search of resources above and completion of the Company Political Spending & Disclosure Worksheet <br><br> • Distribute the CPSD Worksheet, ideally, digitally, and direct groups to complete it for their companies. <br><br> • Be available for any questions. | Complete the CPSD Worksheet sections appropriate to their assigned sources. <br><br> Collaboratively answer the comparison and explanation questions, Ask questions if any part is unclear. |
| **10 - 15 mins** | Groups pair to complete Company Comparison Worksheet <br><br> • Pair groups based on company industry. (The scope of the industry could be flexibly defined here, depending on the number of student groups. For example, Meta Platforms / Facebook could pair with Alphabet / Google, or more broadly with AT&T, etc.) If companies are not in related industries, that is fine; students can see differences too. <br><br> • Distribute the CC Worksheet (one per pair of groups) ideally, digitally, and direct groups to complete. <br><br> • Be available for any questions. | Discuss why their companies might be similar or different in their political activity. <br><br> Complete the CC Worksheet sections appropriate to their assigned sources. Collaboratively answer the comparison and explanation questions. <br><br> Ask questions if any part is unclear.|
| **10 mins** | Debrief / Reflection<br><br>• Important questions (show of hands):<br> ◦ Which party’s candidates did your company’s PAC favor? (For most, no strong lean.) Why?<br> ◦ Did your company spend more on elections or lobbying? (For most, lobbying.) Why?<br><br>• Surprises in your companies’ spending or choices to disclose?<br><br>• Major differences between the two companies you compared?<br><br>• Difficulties in finding the information needed to answer questions? Could you do this for another company?<br><br>• Direct groups to submit their CPSD and CC Worksheets to you |  Answer questions and discuss to summarize their experience.<br><br> Consider how they can or would use the skills developed here in the future (e.g., perhaps in course assignments, if they read about political activity by a company in the news).<br><br> Ask any questions. |




# Assessment & Evaluation

Formative Assessment
- Check in with each group throughout the exercise for any questions, concerns, or difficult to find information. Especially, refer to Appendices A3 and A5 below to check if the information is actually disclosed.
- Feedback: Review and give feedback on the two worksheets as below.


# Additional Notes for the Instructor

I chose the worksheet questions to highlight a few aspects of political activity relevant to my course: the generally bipartisan nature and geographic elements of corporate PAC giving, higher expenditures on lobbying than on elections, differences in scale of political spending between companies, etc. Your course might benefit from different questions: e.g., you might want students to compare “light money” (through the PAC) versus SuperPAC contributions and “dark money” through 501(c)(4)s, to compare federal spending with state level expenditures, to compare direct and indirect (trade association) lobbying in controversial industries (e.g., energy), etc. See note on worksheets below.

A technical point: OpenSecrets PAC profile amounts are based on a two-year election cycle rather than a single fiscal year. The CPSD worksheet requests the two-year amount, and this will generally not make a significant difference, as lobbying expenditures will be much higher. However, if a company reports annual PAC contributions in its report, this may disagree with the OpenSecrets number.

The above reports are generally annual, rather than semiannual. They also generally provide information directly, except perhaps for PAC contributions and lobbying expenditure, which are available on OpenSecrets. Not all reports are so kind.



## Appendix B: Rubrics

I score only for completion, as the distinctions between types of spending are complicated. Further, some political engagement reports are better organized than others. If an answer seems very “off,” consult the source and provide feedback on why this is not correct and where to look instead.
