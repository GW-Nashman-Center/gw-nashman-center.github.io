Civic Learning Activity Guide

# Communicating DC’s Democracy: Using Canva to Make Initiative 83 & Ranked-Choice Voting Fact Sheets

**Creator: Jacob D. Richter, Teaching Assistant Professor of Writing, University Writing Program**

**Original Class Context:** University Writing 1020

**Purpose:** In this single-class activity, students learn how to design a message for a public audience and communicate complex information relating to local democracy for unfamiliar or new voters. Students participate in local democracy through creation of a “fact sheet” educating DC’s public about new election changes stemming from Initiative 83, which institutes ranked-choice voting and participation of independent voters in primary elections in the district. 

**Activity Type:** Active Learning, Group Discussion, Case Study, Peer Review

**Time:** 75 mins \[with various opportunities for expansion/contraction\]

**Class Size:** All class sizes \[with perhaps slightly more functionality for smaller class sizes\]

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

* *Communicate* essential information about DC’s newly passed Initiative 83 (its timeline, basic changes, what ranked-choice voting is, how to fill out a ballot, why election results may be delayed, what independent voters mean for primary elections, what it means for most DC voters)  
* *Design* a “fact sheet” that is tailored for a public, non-specialized audience  
* *Analyze* the rhetorical success of a complex written document, both for a student’s own group’s document as well as a peer group’s creation  
* *Revise* (across a brief but full writing process) to further improve the rhetorical success of the “fact sheet” after collaboration and peer review

# Activity Introduction

In 2024, voters in Washington DC passed a ballot initiative called Initiative 83 with over 73% approval. After a long, grassroots, and community-led campaign, Initiative 83 implements ranked-choice voting in general elections and independent voter participation in DC primary elections. While Initiative 83 is celebrated by many voting rights advocates across the district, ranked-choice voting and independent voter participation in primaries are often misunderstood, especially by ordinary members of the public who may not follow these recent developments closely. This gap in communication is an opportunity that GW students are well-equipped to address. 

In this in-class assignment that can also be modified into a formal project, students (a) learn about Initiative 83 by browsing public materials, (b) use Canva to consider elements like language, tone, message, and document design in writing a "fact sheet" intended for a public DC audience about Initiative 83, (c) move through a brief "peer review" or "audience testing" process in which they review other groups' fact sheets and make revisions to their own, and (d-optional) use Canva's "social media post" feature to create Instagram/social media posts communicating Initiative 83\. Logistically, this activity can be tailored for either a 1 or 2-class session approach or can be made into a formal project. Canva is a free (partially, anyway) digital tool that students can use to make graphic design, and creation of “fact sheets” and Instagram posts, a relatively easy process. In this activity, students are not asked to personally endorse or approve of Initiative 83, but rather are asked to communicate facts about the initiative (passed with over 73% support across all Wards) in forms a public DC audience is likely to learn from. Thus, the goal of the activity is as much about communication, writing for public audiences, and document design as it is about civics and DC politics. This activity can easily be modified for any course that values writing, communication, civics, and local democracy in DC. 

# Pre-Activity Preparation

## Student: Required Prerequisite Knowledge/Skills

* Basic skills in writing 

## Instructor: Required Materials & Set up

* Request students bring computers/tablets to class on day of activity (or arrange for computer access through Gelman Library)  
* Instructor should familiarize themselves with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/free/) (or consider the GW-licensed tool [Adobe Express](https://it.gwu.edu/adobe-express-premium)).  
* Instructor should familiarize themselves with Initiative 83 (start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_83) and [here](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_\(November_2024\)))

## Accessibility Considerations

* Students will need to access [Canva](https://www.canva.com/free/)  (or [Adobe Express](https://it.gwu.edu/adobe-express-premium)) on a laptop or tablet. The differences are relatively minor for this activity, but Canva offers lots of functionality and is a free tool students can continue using when they leave GW. [Adobe Express](https://it.gwu.edu/adobe-express-premium) is a GW-licensed tool that offers visually stunning designs and a simple, seamless workflow. Students will have to set up an Adobe account through GW ahead of time, however, which could complicate completing this activity in a single class session (see [GW IT’s page](https://it.gwu.edu/adobe-express-premium)). For an alternative technology, both Microsoft Word and Google Docs allow for creation of a “fact sheet.” Canva is accessible with screen readers- see “[Accessibility Features](https://www.canva.com/help/canva-accessibility-features/).”  
* International students or students needing to learn about Initiative 83 in languages other than English should use Google Translate for [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_\(November_2024\)) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_83) articles.

# Activity Instructions

| Time | Instructor Delivery | Student Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2 mins | **Phrase 1- Introduction & Engagement** Hook question (put link on screen): “You may have seen [signs like this one](https://51st.news/ranked-choice-voting-explained-initaitive-83/) posted around DC recently. For about two years, they were *everywhere* in the District. If you’d seen them posted to a streetlamp or telephone pole, do you think you would have wondered what they meant or stopped to scan their QR code? They represent local democracy at work\!”  Then: Take 1 minute and list all the questions students would have about this initiative after seeing this sign. Consider mapping/listing these out by writing on the board or in a document, then leave the questions up as a resource for students designing fact sheets.  Purpose and connection to course learning outcomes: “Today, we’ll learn about local democracy and civic life in Washington DC by examining Initiative 83, a new initiative passed with overwhelming support in 2024\. We’ll learn about these important topics in one of the best ways possible: by *teaching* them to others. Today, we’re going to design a message for a public audience and communicate complex election information by creating “fact sheets” to educate DC’s public about new election changes stemming from Initiative 83.” Then, connect to one or more of your course’s learning outcomes.  | Students listen, reflect, and begin to think about local democracy and Initiative 83\. Students view [sign](https://51st.news/ranked-choice-voting-explained-initaitive-83/) and list out questions they might have about voting for Initiative 83 (which they may soon use when constructing their fact sheets\!).  |
| 10 mins | **Phase 2- Learning About Initiative 83** Instruct students to navigate on their computers/tablets to [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_\(November_2024\)) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_83) articles about Initiative 83\. Give students \~4 minutes to browse the articles. Then, briefly explain the core elements of Initiative 83, including its electoral success (72% of voters approved) and its core principles related to ranked-choice voting/independent participation in DC primaries. | Students browse [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_\(November_2024\)) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_83) articles about Initiative 83, paying particular attention to ranked-choice voting and independent participation in DC primaries.  |
| 30 mins | **Phrase 3- Fact Sheet Creation** Instructor begins by explaining task: “construct a well-designed 1-page fact sheet that will explain, in clear and precise language, what Initiative 83 will mean for regular DC voters who may not pay much attention to local democracy.”  Instructor then briefly shows students Canva, including showing them its “Docs” and “Presentations” tabs. This should be brief, as students will generally learn through exploration and through participation.  Instructor explains the fact sheet’s audience: “Your fact sheet is designed for ordinary DC residents who are not familiar with ranked-choice voting, how it works, what the process might look like, and what it means for their ballot. They are also not familiar with independent voter participation in DC primary elections or how that may alter the local political process. Your task is to, clearly and neatly, provide answers for them regarding these important changes to DC’s future elections.” Or, see note below about tailoring the fact sheet for specific sub-audiences (like DC sports fans, people at the National Mall, speakers of Spanish/other languages, etc.). Instructor then allows students, either in partners or individually, to begin writing/designing their “fact sheet.”  Instructor surveys the room, assisting students when necessary and keeping students on track. Instructor provides technical support, intellectual support, design support, and gives general feedback to early fact sheet design.  | Students work, either in partners or independently, to translate the knowledge details of [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_\(November_2024\)) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_83) articles into a stand-alone 1-page “fact sheet” that could be distributed as a PDF online, posted to telephone poles around DC, or posted to websites/social media. Students can use either Canva (most popular), Adobe Express, Microsoft Word, or Google Docs for document design purposes.  For \~30 minutes, students create a fact sheet they can be proud of. Drawing from Initiative 83’s [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_\(November_2024\)) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_83) articles, students use the basics of document design—such as attention to bolding, italics, underlining, font, images/pictures, color, subheadings, white space, and audience needs—to create their fact sheet.  |
| 20 mins | **Phrase 4- Peer Review/Revision** Student groups exchange fact sheets. They briefly survey the new fact sheet. Students are then given a prompt by the instructor: pretend you are new to Initiative 83 and have never heard of either ranked-choice voting or independent voter participation in DC primary elections. *What would you be confused by or unsure* of? Is the visual style engaging? Does the fact sheet account for complexities, ie. what ballots will look like? Do voters need to rank every candidate? How long will counting votes take? Is ranked-choice voting trustworthy? Instructor then asks students to convey their verbal peer review feedback to the document’s creator, leaving time for follow-up questions and resulting discussions.  Students take 5-8 minutes to make revisions to their document based on their peer reviewer’s personalized feedback. | Student groups exchange fact sheets. They briefly survey the new fact sheet.  Then, they begin to enact a “persona” to participate in peer review. Pretending to be an ordinary voter new to ranked-choice voting and independent voter participation in DC primaries, they examine their peer’s document and ask questions such as: “*What would you be confused by or unsure of? Is the visual style engaging? Does the fact sheet account for complexities, ie. what ballots will look like? Do voters need to rank every candidate? How long will counting votes take? Is ranked-choice voting trustworthy*?” Students then convey their verbal peer review feedback to the document’s creator, leaving time for follow-up questions and resulting discussions.  Students take 5-8 minutes to make revisions to their document based on their peer reviewer’s personalized feedback.  |
| 10 mins | **Phrase 5- Reflection** Big-group verbal reflection: Ask students questions such as:  What were the most challenging parts of creating this fact sheet? Do you think audiences would be confused or unsure about any part of your fact sheet?  With more time, what would you add/change to your sheet? Which fact sheet in class do you think is most effective?  Did you use English on your fact sheet? Did anyone think to use, say, Spanish?  What visual choices and visual design features did you choose? Why? What problems did you need to solve?  Did anyone think to provide “follow up” information, ie. who residents should email or call for more information? You’ve used personas and thought about different situations in attempting to gauge the effectiveness of your fact sheets. How might you go about evaluating whether different members of the community have learned about I83 based on your sheet and what they know about it? | Students verbally and internally reflect on the discussion questions the instructor introduces to the class at large.  Students observe other fact sheets, compare and contrast, and consider what changes they would make to their own fact sheet if provided enough time and resources.  For an added dimension, challenge students to use Canva's "social media post" feature to create Instagram/social media posts communicating Initiative 83 using graphic design/writing/Instagram slide-style posts. |

# Assessment & Evaluation

Formative Assessment

* This activity is not heavy on grades or formal assessment. Rather, it is oriented for open-ended creativity, experimentation, and low-stakes engagement and participation.   
* Informally (through verbal feedback), instructor should assess/comment on: (a) language use- is it clear, concise, and informative? (b) content: are major questions addressed proactively (what will ballot look like? must voters rank all candidates? what is successful/unsuccessful about its visual design? what might audiences misunderstand or be confused about?).  
* Ask students to compare their own fact sheet to others in the class. What differences do they observe? What choices did they make/not make? 

# Additional Notes for the Instructor

* This activity will work best if you stress the importance of the “basics of document design,” ie. bolding, italics, underlining, bullets, tables/images, color, subheadings, organization, etc. These “basics” are intuitive (for instance, nearly everyone, even first year students in my experience, institutively know that bolded material is more important hierarchically than italicized material). This sort of document design, which a fact sheet requires if it is to be interesting and readable to a public audience, requires active learning and can’t be fully learned through lecturing/theory alone.   
* This activity works best if approached with an understanding that it will be experimental and open-ended. There is no perfect Initiative 83 fact sheet, but many variously successful possibilities.   
* For an added twist, assign students different sub-audiences (or let them pick their own smaller sub-audience): GW students, Spanish speakers (or other languages), Washington Nationals/Wizards/Spirit/Mystics fans, fans of DC monuments/people walking the National Mall, etc.   
* While this current setup doesn’t truly involve these documents engaging a real public audience by actually appearing in public in the world, keep your options open: a true application would be really cool and would undoubtably be an amazing learning opportunity for GW students.    
* While I’ve designed this as an activity, it is easily modified into a full-fledged project that could be a good fit for political science, international affairs, communication, writing, history, English, or other courses.
