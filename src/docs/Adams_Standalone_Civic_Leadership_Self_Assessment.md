| 1–2                | You may have limited awareness or experience in this area. Consider opportunities for growth, such as observing civic leaders, engaging in group projects, or learning about this competency through coursework or service. | 
| 3                      | You are developing awareness but may not yet consistently act on it. Reflect on what experiences might help you strengthen this competency.        | 
| 4-5                    | You demonstrate a strong orientation in this area. Think about how you can build on this strength to contribute to civic efforts or mentor others.    | 


Public Service Motivation – Reflects your internal commitment to serve others and advance the public good.
Democratic Accountability – Reflects your attention to public trust, transparency, and responsiveness in decision-making.
Political Astuteness – Reflects your ability to navigate diverse viewpoints, build consensus, and lead ethically in complex environments.
Public Value Orientation – Reflects your consideration of how your work or leadership contributes meaningfully to societal benefit.


Summary Profile Interpretation
- High across all domains (scores of 4–5): You likely see yourself as a civic-minded leader and may already be active in community or organizational leadership. Consider ways to deepen or apply your leadership across public contexts.
- Mixed scores (some 4–5, others 1–3): You may be strong in certain areas but have opportunities for development in others. Use your strengths to build confidence while targeting growth areas through service, dialogue, or academic challenges.
- Lower scores (mostly 1–3): This may indicate you’re at the beginning of your civic leadership journey. That’s completely okay—use this reflection as a starting point to explore new ways of thinking about leadership, responsibility, and impact.


Regardless of your results, this activity is about self-awareness—not judgment. The goal is to help you recognize your leadership potential and begin shaping how you want to contribute to your community and field.
