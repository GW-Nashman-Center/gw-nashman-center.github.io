# Understanding government budget

**Creator**: Lang (Kate) Yang, Associate Professor, Trachtenberg School

**Original Class Context**: PPPA 6005, Public Budgeting, Revenue, and Expenditure Analysis

**Purpose**: Through this assignment, students will learn about the essential components of a government budget, practice finding information within a budget, and participate in the government budgeting deliberation process.

**Activity Type**: Case study

**Time**: For the first part of the assignment, students will work outside of the class over the course of a week to review a government’ budget documents and draft a memo. For the optional second part of the assignment, students will participate in an online budget hearing session that usually lasts for one hour, reflect on the experience, and answer a few questions. The instructor may choose to include a brief in-class discussion following the assignment. 

**Class Size**: The assignment can be done by individual students or by small groups of 2-3 students. The recommended total number of students (if individual work) or student groups is 6-10. 

# Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, students will demonstrate the ability to:
- Identify and locate appropriate government budget documents
- Extract relevant information from the budget documents
- Form educated questions/comments for public participation in budget deliberation 


# Task Instructions

1. Identify the local government to study for this assignment. Most importantly, the local government must have budget documents posted on its website for public access.
   
  a. The instructor may ask students to identify local governments of interest within the confinement of budget availability, or assign specific local governments. If the former, the instructor should consider assigning this task ahead of task 2 to give students sufficient preparation time, especially if students are not familiar with web searching for such information.
  
  b. If the assignment includes attending a public hearing (as explained later), students must choose local governments that have scheduled virtual public hearings within the timeframe allowed by the course schedule. The instructor may consider, in this case, identifying and assigning such local governments. 


2. Access and read the budget documents to extract key information. Budget documents can be several hundred pages long, and provide an excellent opportunity for students to learn about extracting useful information from noisy real-life materials. Nevertheless, clear guidance from the instructor is often necessary and appreciated. 
 
  a. Appendix A1 provides an example of the guidance document the instructor may provide. It focuses largely on understanding the overall size and composition of the budget, but has customizable questions that can be made specific to a field of study and students enrolled in the course. 

3. Optional: participate in a virtual public hearing. To induce meaningful participation, the instructor may ask students to prepare questions/comments in advance, even if the students are not actually going to raise these questions at the hearing. In addition, the instructor may pose post-hearing reflection questions and ask students to respond either on a virtual discussion forum or during in-class discussion sessions.
   
  a. Appendix A2 provides an example of pre- and post-hearing questions instructors may ask students to respond to. 
  
  b. If the instructor adopts this portion of the assignment, it is important that the “budget documents” being examined throughout the assignment are proposed budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, not the adopted budget from the current or previous fiscal years. Local governments conduct public hearings to collect feedback on proposed budgets, which will ultimately be adopted by the legislative body of the government. 
  
  c. The difficulty in implementing this portion of the assignment is timing. Local governments do not all follow the same timetable for budget development and deliberation. Therefore, different governments may hold public hearings, sometimes infrequently, on different dates, which may cause logistical challenges for the instructor. One solution is to assign the same local government to all students. Another possibility is to allow a sufficiently long gap between tasks 2 and 3 to accommodate different public hearing dates. 


# Criteria for Success

- Given the complexity and open-endedness of the assignment, activity-based grading is recommended, where a student receives full points for answering all questions, not based on the accuracy of their answers.

# Additional Notes for the Instructor

- Larger governments are more transparent in their budgeting process, and are more likely to post budget documents online and host public hearings virtually. However, larger governments have more complex budgets. The instructor would want to balance the two aspects of feasibility in this assignment. 
- School districts and general purpose governments such as cities and counties are more likely to be transparent in their budgeting process. However, depending on the field of study, special purpose districts, such as public utility districts and water conservation districts, may be of greater interest to students.

Appendix A: Handouts & Slides

## A1. Reading budget documents

**Purpose**: In this assignment, you will read the budget documents identified earlier to extract useful information. Through this process, you will understand the main components of a government budget, practice searching for and identifying relevant information from a large document, as well as synthesize and communicate findings. 

**Task**: Skim through the budget. Pay close attention to the budget summary (if there is one) and the main table reporting on total revenue and total spending. Because budget documents are often very long, it is a good idea to start with the table of contents and identify the summary section/table that may contain the headline numbers. For the last question on the budgeted spending for specific purposes, use the search function (ctrl + F) to search for key words and identify relevant sections of the document. 

Write a short, one-page memo identifying your observations. Write the memo from the perspective of an analyst for a local interest group, which may be the local chamber of commerce or a trade group. Your memo should discuss:

1. The entity and documents you reference (include a link to the budget documents.
2. The size of the budget, that is, planned total spending. List the page number where you find such information. Moreover, is the budget balanced?
3. The major components of spending (policy areas that are funded) and major sources of revenue. List the page number where you find such information.
4. Anticipated changes in total spending from the previous year. List the page number where you find such information.
5. [Customized for each course: here we use cybersecurity as an example.] Does the budget explicitly address the issue of cybersecurity, if so, in what way? Can you identify how much money is appropriated for the purpose of enhancing cybersecurity of government functions or implementing cybersecurity policies in the community?

**Grading criteria**: activity-based grading. By addressing all issues listed above, you will receive full points for answering all questions, not based on the accuracy of your answers.



## A2. Participating in budget hearings

**Purpose**: By now, you have obtained a basic understanding of the local government’s proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. In this part of the assignment, you will participate in the online public hearing session to see public participation in government policymaking in action. 

Task: You will answer four questions, two prior to the hearing and two after the hearing. When all four questions are completed, you will post your responses on a discussion forum thread to share with the rest of the class. After reading about each other’s experience and observations, we will discuss in class the value of public participation in government budgeting and the opportunities for improving public participation. 

1. Pre-hearing:

   1.1. What are the major issues faced by the government that you think should be addressed at the budget hearing?

   1.2. If you were to ask one question or make one comment at the hearing, what would that be? In addition, explain the perspective from which you are raising the question/comment: individual resident, representative of a local interest group, etc.

2. Post-hearing:

   2.1. Were the “major issues” you had identified actually discussed at the hearing? If yes, who initiated such discussions?

   2.2. What is the one observation you would make based on the hearing? The observation could be on your question/comment if you actually raised it, or on other aspects of public participation in the budget process.


**Grading criteria**: activity-based grading. By addressing all issues listed above, you will receive full points for answering all questions, not based on the accuracy of your answers.
