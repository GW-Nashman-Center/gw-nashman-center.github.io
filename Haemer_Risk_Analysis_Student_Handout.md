# Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Activity

**Handout One.** “On-site Response by Fire and Rescue During a Planned Electrical Outage” 

**Description of Site:** The site is a Training and Research Area (TRA) complex.  Maintenance work is planned in Building 648 which houses electrical equipment for the TRA complex.  It is a two-level structure consisting of the ground-level floor, that contains switchgear, control panels, and power systems, and a basement level, that contains electrical cable trays.

Building 648 is protected from fire by two systems, a dry pipe water sprinkler system and a carbon dioxide fire suppression system.   A single fire panel controls both the high-pressure carbon dioxide and dry pipe fire suppression systems.  When the system is activated, carbon dioxide is discharged from numerous nozzles in the ceiling of the ground level floor.  Carbon dioxide is stored in fifty-five 100-pound bottles and its release will create an atmosphere within the building that is immediately dangerous to life and health.

There are several buildings besides Building 648 in the TRA Complex.  About 700 yards from Building 648 is the TRA Emergency Control Center (ECC).  The TRA ECC contains an emergency response truck housed in the garage on the south side of the ECC.  The truck is equipped for emergency fire and rescue response, except that active equipment such as fire extinguishers and oxygen breathing apparatus are stored in racks to facilitate inspection, maintenance, and testing.  The racks are in a storeroom on the north side of the ECC.

**Description of Work:** The work is to perform preventive maintenance activity on the Building 648 electrical switchgear including removal of 4160 volt electrical circuit breakers, vacuuming out breaker cubicles, inspecting ground straps, lubricating racking mechanisms, and basic inspections of the switchgear.  The work is scheduled to start at 6 PM and conclude by the end of the shift at midnight.  The work is scheduled after normal working hours and during the summer to minimize disruptions caused by the loss of power that would occur in conjunction with this work.  The work needs to be complete by midnight so that various environmental protection systems can be restarted.  All thirteen personnel assigned to the TRA Complex that shift are involved in the work activity: a Site Support Services foreman, a TRA foreman, seven electricians, two operators, a utilities operations supervisor, and a fire protection engineer.  

In the past, preventive maintenance on these breakers was performed without de-energizing all sections of the 13,800 and 4160 volt buses, but rather by de-energizing only sections of the buses as they were being worked on.  To enhance electrical safety during the preventive maintenance, the plan is to de-energize all buses at once when the work starts at 6 PM. In addition to Building 648, the power outage will impact several buildings in the TRA Complex, including the ECC. 

**Additional Information:** The TRA Complex has seen decreased use in recent years.  Operations for the TRA Complex faces tight budgets, often operating with a skeleton staff, especially when training and research demands are low during the summer months.   Other relevant points to consider:

- The operators are cross-trained to assist the fire protection engineer with emergency fire and rescue operations.
- To minimize wear-and-tear and maximize availability of emergency equipment, the standing orders are that the fire truck should remain in its garage unless responding to an emergency.
- The garage door on the west side of the ECC must be opened electrically.  The manual back-up door operator has been out-of-service for six months.  Repair parts are on order but are not expected to be delivered until November.
- The ECC has a backup diesel generator on the east side of the garage.  The generator requires 3 to 5 minutes to come up to speed and supply electrical loads.
- The only communications available are radios and landline telephones.  The landline telephones are considered highly reliable.  The radios are reliable depending on atmospheric conditions, generally failing between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 times.  Atmospheric conditions are expected to be favorable during the work.
- The nearest off-site fire and rescue response is about 5 miles away and can be expected to respond within fifteen to twenty minutes, depending on traffic.
- When responding to an emergency involving an “immediately dangerous to life and health” atmosphere, a search-and-rescue efforts is considered successful when completed within five minutes, preferably within three minutes.
- When responding to a fire event, suppressing the fire within fifteen minutes is considered a successful response.



#### Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Activity

**Handout Two:**  Small group assignment.  Perform a PRA of emergency response during a planned electrical outage at the TRA Complex during work in Building 648.  Guidelines for completing this exercise are:

1. Pick a group leader.
2. Pick a spokesman (may be but need not be the same as the leader)
3. Identify the Initiating Event.  From Handout 1, the IE is “emergency fire and rescue response needed”.
4. Identify the decomposing nodes.  For example, two decomposing nodes could be “call to respond to a fire” and “call to respond to a carbon dioxide activation (IDLH atmosphere)”.
5. Develop an outline of possible leaf nodes for each decomposing node.  Consider basic questions:
  a. Who?  On-site or offsite responders?
  b. What? Equipment needed
  c. Where?  Response location -- Building 648 for IDLH atmosphere, TRA Complex for fire.
  d. When?  Backshift, 6PM to Midnight.
  e. Possible failures, like communications glitch, equipment lost or breaks, personnel available, etc.
6. Draft a fault tree for each decomposing node.
7. Research and assign probabilities for each leaf node.  Considering breaking into subgroups for each decomposing node or otherwise dividing the leaf nodes up amongst the group to efficiently complete the fault tree.
8. Reassemble for peer review of the fault trees.  Peer review is an essential part of the PRA process.  Reach a consensus or final decision by the leader.
9. Look for insights from the fault trees.  Are any success paths too hard?  Are the risks for any path unacceptable?  Can alternate plans reduce the risk?  Do the benefits of the alternatives outweigh their costs?
10. The spokesman drafts talking points summarizing the group’s conclusions and synthesizes group input for presentation at the next class.
