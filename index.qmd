## About Civic Learning Materials

The Honey W. Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service and the Center for Teaching Excellence worked with faculty to create new OER materials available to all faculty and staff.  These free materials are designed to engage students by introducing innovative cross-discipline classroom activities/assignments that foster civic learning.

We believe every college graduate—whether in social sciences, the arts, humanities, business, or STEM —should be prepared to engage as an active citizen. This project aims to provide resources for faculty across disciplines to prepare students with the skills and motivations needed to work to make a difference in the quality of life in the community, through both political and non-political processes.

Activities or assignments will create opportunities for students to use academic skills in civic contexts, for example, analyzing an issue or policy, or communicating complex issues (scientific, economic, etc.) to public audiences.
