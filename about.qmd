## Our Approach

```{python}
#| echo: false
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px

# Create a process flow diagram
fig = go.Figure()

steps = ['Discovery', 'Planning', 'Development', 'Testing', 'Deployment', 'Support']
x_pos = list(range(len(steps)))
y_pos = [0] * len(steps)

# Add nodes
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=x_pos, 
    y=y_pos,
    mode='markers+text',
    marker=dict(size=50, color='#2563eb'),
    text=steps,
    textposition='top center',
    textfont=dict(size=12, color='white'),
    name='Process Steps'
))

# Add arrows between steps
for i in range(len(steps)-1):
    fig.add_annotation(
        x=x_pos[i+1], y=y_pos[i+1],
        ax=x_pos[i], ay=y_pos[i],
        xref='x', yref='y',
        axref='x', ayref='y',
        showarrow=True,
        arrowhead=2,
        arrowsize=1,
        arrowwidth=2,
        arrowcolor='#64748b'
    )

fig.update_layout(
    title='Our Development Process',
    showlegend=False,
    xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
    yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
    height=200,
    margin=dict(l=20, r=20, t=40, b=20)
)

fig.show()

## Our Impact by the Numbers

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Impact metrics
impact_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Metric': ['Clients Served', 'Projects Completed', 'Team Members', 'Years of Experience'],
    'Value': [150, 380, 32, 50],
    'Unit': ['Organizations', 'Successfully', 'Talented Professionals', 'Combined Years']
})

# Create a horizontal bar chart
fig = px.bar(impact_data, 
             y='Metric', 
             x='Value', 
             orientation='h',
             title='Our Impact Since 2020',
             color='Value',
             color_continuous_scale='Blues')

fig.update_layout(
    height=300,
    showlegend=False,
    xaxis_title='',
    yaxis_title=''

fig.show()
