## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

2. **Interpret diverse perspectives within news sources**, using evidence-based reasoning to assess how different stakeholders invoke constitutional concepts in support of their positions.
3. **Engage in structured civic discourse**, to explore complex issues with empathy, curiosity, and respect for differing viewpoints.
4. **Synthesize group findings into coherent presentations**, articulating how constitutional principles inform civic decision-making and proposing informed actions or questions for further inquiry.


## Pre-Activity Preparation

Student Preparation:
- Read the Constitution
- Review the six big ideas of the Constitution: Limited Government, Republicanism, Federalism, Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances, and Popular Sovereignty.


Instructor Preparation:

1. Prepare article sets for each big idea
   - Select an issue that has been covered in the national news for at least the past five days. Choose a topic around which there are multiple, valid perspectives. The issue should illustrate Constitutional questions of:
     - Separation of Powers
     - Republicanism
     - Federalism
     - Checks and Balances
     - Popular Sovereignty
     - Limited Government
   - News stories may be from national or local sources. The sources should include a variety of conservative and liberal perspectives. Good sources include quotations from affected parties. Avoid opinion pieces. Explainers are helpful and recommended.

2. Prepare data retrieval sheets for each big idea

3. Assign students to groups and distribute materials


Accessibility Considerations:
- Ensure readability of articles
